III. Gameplay Guide

Connect to a server by opening the lobby and join a server by clicking its name. The 
lobby will show the current map, number of players, and IP of servers running. 
Alternatively, you can manually join a server if you know their IP and their
forwarded port.

There are four gameplay modes: 
- Capture the Flag
- Control Point
- Arena
- Generator

Choose a team, RED or BLU, or select AutoSelect and let us choose your team for you. 
Press N to change your team, or to Spectate and watch the action! Keep in mind you 
tie up a player slot on the server as a spectator!

Press M to open the Class Menu and choose your class. Choose option 0 to let 
us pick a class that might suit you!

The Heads-Up Display on your screen shows your class, the time left in the map, 
your team, your ammunition, and your current health. All classes (except for the 
rifleman) have ammunition that replenishes over time. Certain classes will also 
have HUDs unique to them. Depending on the game mode, the HUD will display the 
locations and status of the intels (Capture the Flag), the status of the Control 
Points (Control Point), the number of players left and the status of the Arena 
Point (Arena), or the health of the Generators (Generator).

The scoreboard shows the current score of every player. It also displays the 
name of the current server and map. 

Capture the Flag:
Find the opposing team's intel and return it to where yours usually sits to score a point.
Score a certain number of points to win the round!

Control Point:
Control Point comes in two flavors, Standard or Attack/Defend:
Standard - Capture all the Control Points to win the match. 
	or
Attack/Defend - RED Team must capture all the Control Points to win,
		and BLU Team must prevent RED from doing so.

Arena:
There is no respawning in this mode, and the last team standing wins the round. If neither
team finishes the other off, then there is a control point you can capture to win the round.
Round wins are cumulative and the team with the most rounds won at the end wins the match.

Generator:
An original mode exclusive to Gang Garrison 2. Both teams have a special generator which 
are the objectives of the map. A team must keep their generator running and destroy the 
enemy generator to win.

----------------------------------------------------------

IV. The Maps

A. The Official Maps:

To run a server using only these maps, open gg2.ini and make sure no custom
map list is specified ("MapRotation=" under [Server] should be left blank). To change
the order the maps are played, change the numbers next to the map names; the maps
will play in numerical order from least to greatest. Place a zero next to a map to ignore it.

1. ctf_truefort
by fishmatt
This classic layout emphasizes good flagrunning and being able to evade a 
strong defense! The colorful rural scenery hides two industrial strongholds.

2. ctf_2dfort
by Vaati
A simple layout designed for fast games and tactical decisions. Don't neglect the 
lower route!

3. ctf_conflict
by agh
This battleground is filled with varied terrain and odd angles! Watch out, there are 
many places to hide and swipe the intelligence when no one will notice.

4. ctf_classicwell
by fishmatt
A nostalgic scenario with an industrial flavor, there are multiple routes around these
imposing complexes but only a few ways in and out. Keep an eye on the upper route!

5. ctf_waterway
by Taters
This trainyard sits atop a canal. The adjacent buildings house two warring factions. 
Keep your cool and watch for snipers, it's a long clear shot back to your base.

6. ctf_orange
by king metroid
Looming under the shadow of a large central tower, two groups plot each other's
demise. Climb the tower to drop down on unsuspecting opponents!

7. cp_dirtbowl
by Vaati
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, BLU is ready to launch it's secret wewapon at
RED's base within Mt. Dirtbowl. RED must push forward while BLU must hold them off
on three map fronts in this control point attack style map.

8. cp_egypt
by Tarzan
Under the blazing desert sun, RED and BLU battle to control an antiquated city.
Fight to maintain a hold on all five control points in this majestic CP map.

9. arena_lumberyard
by Faust
Somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, BLU has made an attack on an important RED 
lumberyard. You can shoot through some of the floors!

10. arena_montane
by Taters and agh
Somewhere in the forests, RED and BLU fight for supremacy over an important propaganda 
radio transmitter. Sticking with the team is best!

11. gen_destroy
by agh
In the first ever generator map for Gang Garrison, RED and BLU must destroy the others'
power generator while keeping their own running!



B. Using Custom Maps:

To run a server using custom maps, make a folder called "Maps" in the same 
path as Gang Garrison 2.1.exe and place the compiled map file (it will have 
a ".png" extension) inside. Create a text file with any name, like "maplist.txt", and 
open gg2.ini. Next to "MapRotation=" under [Server], type the name of this file.

Open your maplist file and type the name of each map you want to play in order:
For instance:

ctf_2dfort
ctf_mynewmap
ctf_orange

would play ctf_2dfort, a custom map with the filename "ctf_mynewmap.png", and 
then ctf_orange. Then it would play ctf_2dfort again. These names are case sensitive.

Players on your server can download maps from the internet when they join if you 
provide a locator file. First, upload your map to the internet, whether on your own 
website or a filehost that allows direct linking. Do not worry if it changes the filename,
as long as it keeps the extension .png it will be fine. Create a file in your Maps folder
called "mapname.locator" where "mapname" is the same as in the file "mapname.png".

Inside this file, simply paste the direct link to your file on the internet. Be careful that
the link is direct and not a php redirect! Now when players join your server, they will
download the map and your locator file so they may also host the map on their servers.


----------------------------------------------------------

V. The Options Menu:

These options can also be set in gg2.ini before running the game. You can also
bring up the menu by pressing 'ESC' in-game.

Player Name: Set your visible name in-game. The maximum length is 25 characters.
Hosting Port: Set the TCP port clients will connect to if you host a game.
Player Limit: Set the number of players, including the host, allowed in your game.
Announce to Lobby: Show your server to players in the Lobby. Setting this to off 
	allows you to host a private game for those who know your IP.
Fullscreen: Set to On to run in fullscreen. Setting it to off means the game is
	windowed.
Ingame Music: Toggles the ingame music track on and off.
Particles: Toggles smoke and explosion effects. Turning this off or using the
	alternative particles may reduce graphical lag.
Gibs: Toggles body parts when a character explodes. Turning this setting down may
	reduce graphical lag.
Healer Radar: Toggles the in-game healer radar HUD for Healers.
Show Healing: Toggles healing HUDs for the Healer and players who are being healed.
Additional Healthbar: Toggles a floating healthbar above your head in game.
Kill Cam: Toggles the killcam when you die. Turn it off if you get angry easily!
V Sync: Toggles V Sync. Useful if you notice 'tearing' on your screen during 
	the game.
Controls: Change your in-game controls to suit your own taste.

VI. Gameplay Tips

Runner:
- Use paths that no other class can use!
- Your scattergun does a surprising amount of damage!
- Keep some ammo saved up in case you need to fight an infiltrator!

Firebug:
- Use your airblast to push foes into a bad spot!
- Always extinguish your teammates with the airblast if they're on fire!
- Put a foe on fire and let the afterburn take care of the rest!

Rocketman:
- Your rockets can go through teammates!
- Rocketjump up to high platforms or to rain rockets from above!
- Rockets can destroy the detonator's mines with an explosion!

Overweight:
- Eat a manvich when it's safe, not when there are enemies around!
- Don't eat a manvich if a healer is waiting to heal you!
- Remember to retreat if you're taking too much damage!

Detonator:
- You can detonate your mines in the air; they don't have to 'stick'
  to a surface to detonate!
- Your mines get stronger the longer they are out, to a maximum of 50 
  damage!
- Sticky mines can destroy other detonator's mines with an explosion!
- Shoot a sticky and detonate it at the same time while pointing down
  to propel yourself like a Rocketman!

Healer:
- You heal and charge superburst twice as fast on teammates low on health!
- You slowly regenerate your health!
- Quickly use your medigun to heal off afterburn!
- Use your superburst to get past a tight chokepoint!

Constructor:
- You regenerate Nuts and Bolts slowly, but picking up metal from a
  destroyed autogun instantly gives you 50! Health cabinets also give
  you all your Nuts and Bolts back!
- Autoguns can't shoot straight up, so watch out!

Infiltrator:
- The enemy can still hear you jump even if you are cloaked!
- Your revolver is a lot stronger than it looks! It has a lot of
  range too!
- Passive invisibility is always useful!

Rifleman:
- Stay moving in case an infiltrator is eyeing your back!
- Scope out if you need to move around!

Secret Class:
- There is no secret class, and you can 'QQ' about it.
